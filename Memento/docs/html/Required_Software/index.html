<span class='type-moin'><h1 id='Required_Software'>Required Software</h1><p>The software is written in the <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python programming
language</a>, tested with Python 2.7, and makes use of a number of additional
packages or libraries. These prerequisites are presented below in their own
distinct sections.
</p><h2 id='Operating_Environment'>Operating Environment</h2><p>The programs provided are meant to be run from a command-line environment,
making use of the basic operating system facilities to communicate with the
operator and to accept operator-specified parameters, such as the location of
files to be processed.
</p><p>For convenient use of the programs, a Unix-like environment is recommended
(GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, and so on). The software will work on Windows, but
running it using the command prompt is not as convenient as it is on the
Unix-like platforms.
</p><h2 id='A_Note_about_Python_Packaging'>A Note about Python Packaging</h2><p>Some operating system distributions do not provide the <tt>pip</tt> utility either as
a module or as a standalone program. See the
<a href="https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/">Installing
Packages</a> section of the <a href="https://packaging.python.org/">Python Packaging
User Guide</a> for advice about setting up <tt>pip</tt>:

command line</a>
</p><h2 id='Prerequisites'>Prerequisites</h2><p>The software prerequisites are described below.
</p><h3 id='Python_2.7'>Python 2.7</h3><p>Source: <a href="https://www.python.org/">https://www.python.org/</a>
</p><p>Typically, operating system distributions provide Python 2.7 as standard or as
an installable package. To check if you have Python 2.7 available on your
system, open a command prompt and type the following:
</p><pre class='level-3 type-opaque'>
python2.7
</pre><p>If the output from the command indicates Python 2.7, you may proceed to
install other prerequisites. (Use the Ctrl-D key combination to exit Python.)
</p><p>If Python 2.7 does not seem to be installed, consult your operating system
documentation for the details of installing a suitable package.
</p><h3 id='spaCy'>spaCy</h3><p>Source: <a href="https://spacy.io/">https://spacy.io/</a>
</p><p>Required components:
</p><ul><li>spaCy (the package itself)
</li><li>es (Spanish data model)

</li></ul><p>Installing the software and data can be done using Python packaging tools:
</p><pre class='level-3 type-opaque'>
python -m pip install -U --user spacy
python -m spacy download es --user
</pre><p>In the above, the <tt>--user</tt> option indicates that the software will be
installed for a given system user, as opposed to needing additional privileges
to install it for many users.
