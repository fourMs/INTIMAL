= Data Exploration =

The `explore.py` program can be used with an output data directory to
investigate and explore the generated data. For example, with the output
directory called `OUTPUT`:

{{{
./explore.py OUTPUT
}}}

This program provides an interactive interface that permits the viewing of
fragments and navigation between related fragments.

== Choosing a Starting Fragment ==

Upon starting the program, a list of all known fragment identifiers is
presented. A prompt then appears to invite the user to specify a fragment
identifier to start exploring from:

{{{
fragment>
}}}

Here, one of the many identifiers can be entered exactly as it appears.
Otherwise, a fragment can be chosen at random by pressing Enter/Return.
