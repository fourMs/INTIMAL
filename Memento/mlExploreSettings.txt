# This file contains tunable parameters for the class FeatureBox
# in the file mlExplore.py. Any lines starting with '#' is not
# read by the program. The program has two different
# functionalities: step detection and rotation detection.
# The first functionality has four different ways of detecting
# a step:
#
#    Accel is acceleration magnitude.
#    Jerk is rate of change in acceleration magnitude
#    Area is the sum of all accelerations
#    Rotation is the rotation magnitude.
#
# Whenever Accel is on a peak, the detector checks whether the
# values for Accel, Jerk, Area and Rotation are within the
# tolerances. If they are, the peak is registered as a step.
#
# Step detector tolerances:
#             Accel    Jerk      Area   Rotation
minimumStep   0.05     0	 0	0 
maximumStep   120      120	 120	120 
#
# The rotation detector works by checking whether the rate of
# rotation around the Y axis is larger than the tolerances.
# If the rotation rate larger than the Left column or smaller
# than the Right column, rotation is reported as being detected. 
#
# Rotation tolerances:
#                Left    Right
