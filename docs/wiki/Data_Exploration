= Data Exploration =

The `explore.py` program can be used with an output data directory to
investigate and explore the generated data. For example, with the output
directory called `OUTPUT`:

{{{
./explore.py OUTPUT
}}}

This program provides an interactive interface that permits the viewing of
fragments and navigation between related fragments.
