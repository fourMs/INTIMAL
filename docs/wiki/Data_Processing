= Data Processing =

A number of concepts are central to the work done by this software. These, 
along with the processing of the data and the modelling of the data using such
concepts are described below.

From the [[Required Data|input data]], a collection of '''fragments''' are
obtained, each of which defines a region of text corresponding to a period of
audio. Each of these fragments may also have category information associated
with it.

A number of processing steps are undertaken with the populated fragments:

 * The removal of fragments having no corresponding text
 * The optional removal of uncategorised fragments
 * The normalisation of category names
 * The correction of accents due to data input limitations

In order to work more productively with the fragments, a number of other steps
are undertaken:

 * The removal of punctuation in words
 * The stemming of certain kinds of words to obtain their root forms
 * The conversion to lower case of certain kinds of words
 * The grouping of words into compound terms for things like proper nouns

In general, a '''term''' is defined as a unit of text, being equivalent to a
single word in most instances, but with a sequence of more than one word
potentially defining a named entity.

Finally, certain kinds of words are eliminated, leaving only particular kinds
of words or terms (such as nouns and adjectives). A dictionary of terms can be
used to narrow down the words in fragments still further.

Consequently, each fragment is associated with a collection of terms, with
each term having a particular '''frequency''' - that is, a number of
occurrences - within that particular fragment.

== Statistical Data Products ==

A number of statistical products are obtained for the purpose of inspection,
to get an impression of the nature of the data. These are produced in the
[[Output Data|output data]]. Some of these products are also used for further
computation.

The '''term frequency''' indicates the number of times each given term
appears. This quantity when considered for the entire set of processed
fragments is merely used to show how common certain terms are. However, it is
also meaningful when individual fragments are considered.

The '''term document frequency''' indicates the number of fragments in which
each given term appears (regardless of how many times it appears in any given
fragment).

For example, a term might appear in 15 different places in total across 8
fragments. For the purposes of this software, it would have a frequency of 15
for the entire collection of fragments and a document frequency of 8:

f,,t,, = 15

df,,t,, = 8

Meanwhile, the '''inverse document frequency''' of each term is computed from
the document frequency of the term and the number of documents (fragments) as
follows:

idf,,t,, = log,,10,,(n,,docs,, / (1 + df,,t,,))

Where idf,,t,, is the term's inverse document frequency, df,,t,, is the term's
document frequency, and n,,docs,, is the number of fragments.

Using the previous example values, the described term would have an inverse
document frequency from a set of 49 documents as follows:

n,,docs,, = 49

idf,,t,, = log,,10,,(n,,docs,, / (1 + df,,t,,)) = log,,10,,(49 / (1 + 8)) =
log,,10,,(49 / 9) = log,,10,,(7) = 0.954

A term appearing in every document would have an inverse document frequency as
follows:

idf,,every,, = log,,10,,(49 / (1 + 49)) = log,,10,,(49 / 50) = -0.009

A term appearing in only one document would have the following value:

idf,,one,, = log,,10,,(49 / (1 + 1)) = log,,10,,(49 / 2) = 1.389

Thus, it can be seen that uncommon terms have higher values, with this
property being employed in similarity computations as described below.

== Computing Fragment Relationships ==

A process of comparison is undertaken with each possible pair of fragments
assessed for similarity. Where some similarity exists, a '''connection'''
between these fragments is established.

The similarity computation involves the term frequencies for each fragment,
with a '''term vector''' being defined as a mapping from each term in a
fragment to a '''weight''' for that term. Such a weight is derived from the
term's frequency in that fragment.

For example, a term may appear three times in a particular fragment d, thereby
having a frequency of three:

f(t, d) = 3

In some approaches, the weight of the term in the term vector would also be
three:

w,,t,d,, = 3

In the approach taken in this software, a scaling factor is applied to favour
less common terms. Consequently, the inverse document frequency of a term is
multiplied to the term frequency for the fragment:

w,,t,d,, = f(t, d) * idf,,t,,

For example, for the reasonably common term used above:

w,,t,d,, = 3 * 0.954 = 2.862

Two term vectors may then be combined to produce a similarity result for the
contributing fragments. Consider the following vectors - d,,1,, and d,,2,, -
involving all terms encountered in two fragments:

|| Terms: || "gallina" || "gallo" || "ganso" || "pato" || "pollo" ||
|| d,,1,, || 0         || 0       || 1.5     || 1.2    || 2.5     ||
|| d,,2,, || 2.8       || 2.6     || 1.6     || 0      || 1.3     ||

The process of combining term vectors involves multiplying the weights of
each term together, producing a dot product of the vectors involved.

d,,1,, . d,,2,, = 0 + 0 + (1.5 * 1.6) + 0 + (2.5 * 1.3) = 2.4 + 3.25 + 5.65

An eventual similarity between fragments also involves the magnitude of the
term vectors. This is divided into the dot product, yielding a measure that
may be interpreted as the cosine of an angle between the vectors:

cos ''theta'' = d,,1,, . d,,2,, / (|d,,1,,| |d,,2,,|) = 5.65 / (3.15 * 4.34) =
0.75

A value of 1 indicates a value of the angle ''theta'' of 0 and thus complete
similarity between the vectors, with a value of 0 indicating that the vectors
do not share terms and cannot be regarded as having any similarity.
