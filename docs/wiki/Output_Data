= Output Data =

When the software is run on suitable [[Required Data|input data]], two kinds
of output data products are generated in the output directory:

 * Reports, providing an overview of the nature of the data
 * Structured data, for use by other programs

These products are a consequence of the modelling and [[Data Processing|
processing]] of the input data.

== Reports ==

The following report files are generated:

|| '''File'''                     || '''Description'''                        ||
|| `connections.txt`              || connections of pairs of fragments        ||
|| `fragments.txt`                || details of each textual fragment         ||
|| `related.txt`                  || fragments and those most closely related ||
|| `related_by_category.txt`      || related fragments in the same category   ||
|| `term_categories.txt`          || the categories associated with each term ||
|| `term_fragments.txt`           || the fragments associated with each term  ||
|| `term_frequencies.txt`         || term frequencies across all fragments    ||
|| `term_doc_frequencies.txt`     || term document frequencies                ||
|| `term_inv_doc_frequencies.txt` || term inverse document frequencies        ||
|| `terms.txt`                    || the terms found in each category         ||
|| `words.txt`                    || all known words in their original form   ||

== Structured Data ==

Although the reports aim to be informative, they are not intended to be
machine-readable. Consequently, a `data` directory within the output directory
is populated with structured data for interpretation by other programs.

Within the `data` directory are a number of other directories, each bearing a
fragment identifier for all processed fragments. The general form of this
directory hierarchy is as follows:

{{{
<output directory>
  data
    <fragment identifier>
      text
      rotation
        <related fragment index>
        ...
      translation
        <related fragment index>
        ...
    ...
}}}

Each fragment-specific subdirectory of `data` (denoted using `<fragment
identifier>` above) contains the following:

|| '''File or Directory''' || '''Description'''                               ||
|| `text`                  || A file containing the original fragment text    ||
|| `rotation`              || A directory containing related fragment details ||
|| `translation`           || A directory containing related fragment details ||

The `rotation` and `translation` directories each contain files labelled with
fragment index numbers, starting from 0, indicating the most closely related
fragments in descending order of similarity to the fragment identified by the
parent directory. In each of these files is the identifier of the related
fragment.

Thus, to identify the most closely related `rotation` fragment of an
identified fragment, the following file within that fragment's directory would
be read:

{{{
rotation/0
}}}

The contents of this file would then be used to identify a directory within
the `data` directory.
