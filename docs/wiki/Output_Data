= Output Data =

When the software is run on suitable [[Required Data|input data]], two kinds
of output data products are generated in the output directory:

 * Reports, providing an overview of the nature of the data
 * Structured data, for use by other programs

These products are a consequence of the modelling and [[Data Processing|
processing]] of the input data.

== Basic Information ==

The following basic information files are generated:

|| '''File'''                     || '''Description'''                        ||
|| `connections.txt`              || connections of pairs of fragments        ||
|| `fragments.txt`                || details of each textual fragment         ||
|| `words.txt`                    || all known words in their original form   ||

== Reports ==

The following report files are generated:

|| '''File'''                     || '''Description'''                        ||
|| `related.txt`                  || fragments and those most closely related ||
|| `related_by_category.txt`      || related fragments in the same category   ||
|| `term_categories.txt`          || the categories associated with each term ||
|| `term_fragments.txt`           || the fragments associated with each term  ||
|| `term_frequencies.txt`         || term frequencies across all fragments    ||
|| `term_doc_frequencies.txt`     || term document frequencies                ||
|| `term_inv_doc_frequencies.txt` || term inverse document frequencies        ||
|| `terms.txt`                    || the terms found in each category         ||

== Structured Data ==

Although the reports aim to be informative, they are not intended to be
machine-readable. Consequently, a `data` directory within the output directory
is populated with structured data for interpretation by other programs.

Within the `data` directory are a number of other directories, each bearing a
fragment identifier for all processed fragments. The general form of this
directory hierarchy is as follows:

{{{
<output directory>
  data
    <fragment identifier>
      text
      rotation
        <related fragment index>
          fragment
          measure
          similarity
        ...
      translation
        <related fragment index>
          fragment
          measure
          similarity
        ...
    ...
}}}

Each fragment-specific subdirectory of `data` (denoted using `<fragment
identifier>` above) contains the following:

|| '''File or Directory''' || '''Description'''                               ||
|| `text`                  || A file containing the original fragment text    ||
|| `rotation`              || A directory containing related fragment details ||
|| `translation`           || A directory containing related fragment details ||

The `rotation` and `translation` directories each contain directories labelled
with fragment index numbers, starting from 0, indicating the most closely
related fragments in descending order of similarity to the fragment identified
by the parent directory. In each of these directories is a file containing the
identifier of the related fragment.

Thus, to identify the most closely related `rotation` fragment of an
identified fragment, the following file within the output directory would be
read:

{{{
data/<fragment>/rotation/0/fragment
}}}

The contents of this file would then be used to identify a directory within
the `data` directory containing the details of the related fragment.
