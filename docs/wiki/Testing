= Testing =

A collection of tests can be found in the `tests` directory. These programs
can be run directly provided that the `PYTHONPATH` is set appropriately and
that Python can find the modules provided by this distribution. For example,
the following will run a test program in the `tests` directory:

{{{
PYTHONPATH=. ./tests/test_connections.py
}}}

The test programs will produce a series of `Success` or `Failure` outputs. If
working correctly, only `Success` outputs are to be expected.
