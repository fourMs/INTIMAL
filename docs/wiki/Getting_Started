To be able to use this software, appropriate data is required along with the
means to run the software. See the [[Required Data]] and [[Required Software]]
documents for more details.

To actually run the software, commands of the following form should work:

{{{
./build.py OUTPUT DATA/*.xml
./export.py OUTPUT
}}}

Here, a directory for output data is supplied as `OUTPUT`. Meanwhile, input
data is specified as residing in the `DATA` directory, with this directory
needing to be initialised by the user before running the above command.

The form of the output data is described in the [[Output Data]] document.
