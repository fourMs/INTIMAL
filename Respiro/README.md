Introduction
============

RESPIRO is a live, telematic transmission of breathing signals, which are sonified in each location. It was created for the use with FLOW™ breathing sensors (<https://www.sweetzpot.com/flow>), and was tested in the INTIMAL Lond-Distance Improvisation (Telematic Sonic Performance) between the cities of Oslo, Barcelona and London, May 7th, 2019.
