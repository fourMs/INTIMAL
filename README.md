# INTIMAL
INTIMAL project
INTIMAL is a physical-virtual "embodied" system for relational listening, to be used within the practice of networked and telematic sonic performance. INTIMAL explores sense of place and sense of presence in the context of human migration.

INTIMAL has released two modules in GitHub:

MEMENTO, a co-located, and “embodied” navigation system of an oral archive with Colombian women’s testimonies of conflict and migration;
RESPIRO, a live, telematic transmission of breathing signals, which are locally sonified in each location;

INTIMAL is a research and artwork by Ximena Alarcón, and has been first developed at RITMO Centre for Interdisciplinary studies in Rhythm, Time and Motion, Department of Musicology, at the University of Oslo.

It has been developed and implemented by RITMO Researchers, Research Assistants and students from the Masters in Music, Communication, and Technology, UiO and NTNU:

Paul Boddie

Eigil Aandhal
Eirik Dhal
Elias Sukken Andersen

The INTIMAL project received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Sklodowska- Curie grant agreement No. 752884, and has been partially supported by the Research Council of Norway through its Centres of Excellence scheme, project number 262762.
